# ESP32 Interfacing Project

This repository contains modules and examples for interfacing with the ESP32 microcontroller, including **UART, ADC, GPIO, PWM, and GSM**.  
It provides a clean structure for handling communication, sensor readings, pin control, PWM output, and GSM communication.

## Features

### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
- Send and receive serial data
- Support for multiple baud rates
- Example usage for communication with PCs or other MCUs

### ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
- Read analog signals from sensors
- Configurable resolution
- Example: reading voltage from potentiometers or sensors

### GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
- Control digital pins (High/Low)
- Configure pins as input or output
- Supports interrupts and event handling

### PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
- Generate PWM signals on configurable pins
- Adjustable frequency and duty cycle
- Example usage for controlling LEDs or motors

### GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)
- Handle GSM communication for sending/receiving SMS or using cellular networks
- Initialize GSM module and manage network connection
- Example: sending an alert SMS from sensors via GSM


### Notes
- Each module has its own header and source file.
- Include the corresponding header in your main code to use the module.
- Example usage for each module can be found in the `examples/` folder (if provided).
